# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
An application to save a personalized book cover. The app is giving an individual the ability to easily save a book cover through an easy to read page. The app gives an individual multiple tabs with which to modify/save an image.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Through gitHub they can access the repository. They can then git clone (with the relevant saved information available in the repository) to create their own "copy" or clone. They will then need to cd (change directory) into their new directory and open the app using code . (if using VS Code) to view it their text editor. They can then type open index.html to access it in a browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?) 
The project took roughly 20 hours while occasionally collaborating with other groups. We are two weeks into the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Writing clean, DRY javascript
Exploring the connections between HTML, CSS, and Javascript
And writing code collaboratively
We worked with our terminals, vs code, a web application, zoom/slack, using html/css/javascript, gitHub

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Effectively collaborating together to achieve goals laid out by the spec provided.
Being able to create covers with randomized or specific information. 
Being able to identify and fix code if it caused an error.

There were some struggles with git work flow that were resolved by followed attention to detail and (jolly) cooperative action.
